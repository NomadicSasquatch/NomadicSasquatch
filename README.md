## 🚀 Featured Projects
[**Pathfinding Visualiser**](https://github.com/NomadicSasquatch/pathfinder)
- An engaging, web-based visualiser for pathfinding algorithms, featuring user authentication, customizable wall patterns, and real-time maze generation
- Users can register or log in to save up to three unique pattern “slots,” ensuring a personalized experience. Guest users can still explore the visualiser with temporary patterns, which remain until the application is refreshed or closed.

[**Physics Simulated Asteroid Game**](https://github.com/NomadicSasquatch/Asteroids)
- This project puts a twist on the classic arcade-style Asteroids Game where players navigate a spaceship, destroy asteroids, and strive for a high score.
- Implemented in Java and every interaction is simulated by real physics laws and theorems, such as asteroid collisions obeying conservation of energy and momentum and kinematics.

[**Hospital Management System**](https://github.com/NomadicSasquatch/SC2002-Hospital-Management-System)
- A simulated hospital management system that is cleanly laid and streamlined using OO concepts and SOLID principles
- Wide array of interconnected functionalities that are unique to each user type
