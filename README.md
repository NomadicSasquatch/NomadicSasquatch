## üöÄ Featured Projects
[**Pathfinding Visualiser**](https://github.com/NomadicSasquatch/pathfinder)
- An engaging, web-based visualiser for pathfinding algorithms, featuring user authentication, customizable wall patterns, and real-time maze generation
- Users can register or log in to save up to three unique pattern ‚Äúslots,‚Äù ensuring a personalized experience. Guest users can still explore the visualiser with temporary patterns, which remain until the application is refreshed or closed.

[**Physics Simulated Asteroid Game**](https://github.com/NomadicSasquatch/Asteroids)
- This project puts a twist on the classic arcade-style Asteroids Game where players navigate a spaceship, destroy asteroids, and strive for a high score.
- Implemented in Java and every interaction is simulated by real physics laws and theorems, such as asteroid collisions obeying conservation of energy and momentum and kinematics.

[**Phishing Link Detection System**](https://github.com/NomadicSasquatch/Phishing-Link-Detection)
- The Phishing Link Detection System utilises machine learning techniques to accurately classify URLs as phishing or legitimate
- This project incorporates data preprocessing, feature selection, class balancing with SMOTE, and hyperparameter-tuned models like Random Forest, ensuring high accuracy and reliability

[**Hospital Management System**](https://github.com/NomadicSasquatch/SC2002-Hospital-Management-System)
- A simulated hospital management system that is cleanly laid out and streamlined using OOP concepts along with SOLID and other design principles 
- Wide array of interconnected functionalities that are unique to each user type
